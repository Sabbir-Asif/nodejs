## Understanding `^` and `~` in Node.js Versioning

When you see version numbers like this in `package.json`:

```json
"some-package": "^1.2.3"
```

or

```json
"some-package": "~1.2.3"
```

The `^` (caret) and `~` (tilde) tell `npm` which versions of the package are allowed when installing or updating.

### What `^1.2.3` Means (Caret)

This says:

> "Install any newer version, **as long as the first number (major version) stays the same**."

So:

* `^1.2.3` will match versions like `1.2.4`, `1.3.0`, `1.9.9`
* But **not** `2.0.0` or anything higher

If the version is `^0.2.3`, it becomes more restrictive:

* It will only allow updates up to, but not including, `0.3.0`

Because when the major version is `0`, it usually means the package is still unstable, so even minor updates might break things.

### What `~1.2.3` Means (Tilde)

This says:

> "Only allow small updates — bug fixes — but no new features."

So:

* `~1.2.3` will match versions like `1.2.4`, `1.2.9`
* But **not** `1.3.0` or higher

It’s stricter than `^`, and only allows changes to the **last digit** (patch version).

### Summary Table

| Symbol   | Meaning                                | Example Range    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `^1.2.3` | Allow updates up to next major version | `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0` |
| `~1.2.3` | Allow updates up to next minor version | `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0` |

### When to Use Which?

* Use `^` when you want new features and improvements, but want to avoid breaking changes.
* Use `~` when you want to stay safe and only accept small bug fixes.
